### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Amedeo!

I am currently in my final semester at ODU as a senior and look forward to graduating in December. I will be graduating with a degree in Game Design - Development and a minor in Computer Science. When I am not at school or at work I like to spend my time doing a variety of different things, most of which is gaming. I am currently hooked on Final Fantasy XIV (and have been for a while) but I love playing different genres of games. My personal favorites are RPGs but I have also recently been playing a lot of Horror games with my friends.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently employed at TopGolf Virginia Beach.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an augmented reality game at ODU.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with code.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I'll try my best to help!
- ðŸ“« Reach me via mfind003@odu.edu
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Even though my favorite genre of games are RPGs, you will find me ranked in the highest tier of every game I play. Including but not limited to: League of Legends, Valorant, Overwatch, Rainbow Six: Siege, and Pokemon!
