### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Amedeo!

I am currently an ODU alumnus! When I am not at work I like to spend my time doing a variety of different things, most of which is gaming. I am currently hooked on Final Fantasy XIV (and have been for a while) but I love playing different genres of games. My personal favorites are RPGs but I have also recently been playing a lot of Horror games with my friends.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently employed at Verizon.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m experienced with C++, Java, Python, and Unity.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an augmented reality game.
- ðŸ”­ Currently working on a personal project in Unity.
