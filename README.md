### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Amedeo!

I am currently in my final semester at ODU as a senior and look forward to graduating in December. I will be graduating with a degree in Game Design - Development and a minor in Computer Science. When I am not at school or at work I like to spend my time doing a variety of different things. I am currently hooked on Final Fantasy XIV (and have been for a while) but I love playing all kinds of games.
