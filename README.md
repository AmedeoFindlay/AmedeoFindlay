### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Amedeo!

I am currently an ODU alumnus! When I am not at work I like to spend my time doing a variety of different things, most of which is gaming. I am currently hooked on Final Fantasy XIV (and have been for a while) but I love playing different genres of games. My personal favorites are RPGs but I have also recently been playing a lot of Horror games with my friends.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently employed at TopGolf Virginia Beach.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m currently learning C++, Java, Python, and Unity.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an augmented reality game at ODU.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I'll try my best to help!
- ðŸ“« Reach me via medhanyefindlay@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His
- âš¡ Fun fact: Even though my favorite genre of games are RPGs, you will find me playing every type of game. Including but not limited to: League of Legends, Valorant, Overwatch, Dead by Daylight and more!
